# About

We believe in future where learning and play are united.

We want to provide players financial opportunities to mitigate unforeseen problems such as poverty and inequality. And above all, imagine a future where gaming can change the world.

Our project's mission is to create a playful and user-friendly way for the general public to understand and adopt block-chain technology. 
Our project uses NFT racehorses as a tool to entertain and learn for the future of gaming and virtual reality.
